**Our team agrees to do our best to support each other throughout the semester, which will include:**

**Communication:**

1.Team Meeting:

 Meeting Date:Thursday Saturday weekly 
 
 Meeting Time: 90 minutes per meeting 
 
 Software for Meeting: Zoom or in person Note Taker: rotation for each team member

2.Assistance:

 Each team member can be contacted through email and weChat. We commit to responding to emails within 48 hours. Everyone helps each other with general problems. Since all members are relatively similarly skilled, everyone can collaborate when necessary.

3.Respect:

 ● Being mindful and respectful of group member commitments and responsibilities
 
 ● Encouraging open communication about challenges that group members are facing
 
 ● Giving group members the benefit of the doubt and the opportunity to explain themselves when something goes wrong and to resist jumping to judgement
 
 ● Seek and listen to alternate opinions and ideas without bias. To be able to adequately showcase all relevant abilities.



**Collaboration:**

1.Work Distribution:

 Our team will try to assign equal workload among team members. If we encounter unexpected complications or unforeseen work, we would redistribute our tasks or have people who finished their part earlier or have intention to do extra work to take on the new tasks. All the team members should also be responsive since this project is a collaborative work.

2.Time Commitment:

 Each group member is expected to spend at least 3 hours on this final project. Any prior time commitments, like review of literature, preparation and pre-process of dataset, are required by every team member. If any unforeseen complications occur, each group member should help each other to resolve the issue.
 Everybody should be punctual or at least try to be on time. Everyone tries to be active in the group.

3.Conflict Resolution:

 As mentioned before, all team members should contribute equally and be respectful to other people and their contributions. An offender who does not contribute to team work or disrespect other team members will be given proper punishment. The rest of team members will decide the appropriate punishment based on offensive behaviors. The meeting will feature a line of questioning. If a teammate does not uphold their fair share then that teammate will be subject to a worse peer assessment than those who did uphold their share. Unacceptable behaviors will be reported to the TAs and course instructor for further penalties depending on college’s academic policies.
